way user engagement does or does not change. Or it may mean that the users who play our game on a daily basis are

- **Retain the Current Gate Placement:** These results show that users who play our game on a weekly basis have lower 
overall user retention if the first game gate is moved up to level 40. In this case, it may be best to keep the gate 
where it is rather than move it since we observed a negative change in user retention.
- **Investigate User Behaviour Beyond 7 Days:** However, because we saw no significant change in retention after 1 day 
yet we saw one after 7 days, it may be beneficial to run this type of experiment over longer time periods. For example, 
testing how retention changes after 7 and 14 days.
- **Segmentation of User Types:** Segment your users based on play patterns. For example, casual players might react 
differently to gates compared to more engaged players. Personalizing gate placement for different segments could 
improve overall retention. This can be implemented by analyzing high-engagement versus low-engagement users and 
adjusting gameplay or challenges accordingly.
- **Optimize User Experience Around The Gate:** Analyze the gate's mechanics. Could it be too difficult or disruptive 
at level 40? Consider making the gate less challenging, adding a reward system, or offering a small in-game incentive 
(like extra lives, bonuses, or faster progression) to make passing the gate more appealing.

1. Testing different hypothesis like run additional A/B tests with varied gate placements. \n
2. Segment users based on engagement patterns and tailor the experience. \n
3. Explore user behavior for longer periods (14 or 30 days) to assess long-term effects. \n

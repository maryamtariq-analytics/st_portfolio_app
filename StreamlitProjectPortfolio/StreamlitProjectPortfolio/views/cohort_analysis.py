st.write("""
The business is noticing a decline in customer retention over time and is unsure which factors are driving this trend. 
Using cohort analysis, the goal is to identify patterns in customer retention behavior, track how different cohorts of 
customers engage with the product or service over time, and find opportunities to enhance retention and reduce churn.
""")

st.subheader('Methodology:')
st.markdown("""
- *Data Wrangling* (cleaning data, date manipulation).
- Conducted *Retention Cohort Analysis* (using Time and Behaviour patterns).
- Interpreted Results.

st.subheader('Skills:')
st.markdown("""
**Programming Language:** Python \n
**Data Manipulation Libraries:** Pandas \n 
**Visualization Libraries:** Seaborn, Matplotlib \n
**App and Dashboard Tool:** Streamlit \n
**Statistics:** Aggregating
""")
st.subheader('Results:')
st.markdown("""
***1. Initial Drop in Retention (CohortIndex 1 to 2)***
- Across all cohorts, the retention drops drastically from **100%** in the first month to around **20-40%** by the 
second month (CohortIndex 2). \n
***2. Long-term Retention (After Month 2)***
- After the second month, retention continues to decline but at a slower rate.
- For example, in the **January 2011** cohort, retention falls from 24% in the second month to 13% by the 12th month. \n
***3. Variation in Cohorts***
- Some cohorts retain customers better than others over time. For example, the **December 2010** cohort maintains 
retention levels higher than many other cohorts after 6-7 months.
- In contrast, the **June 2011** cohort shows a significant drop in retention early on, with 10% retention by the fourth 
month. \n
***4. Churn Patterns***
- For most cohorts, retention drops significantly after 2-4 months and stabilizes at lower percentages in subsequent 
months. This suggests that the **critical time to focus on reducing churn** may be within the first few months. \n
***5. Potential Outliers***
- Some months, like **August 2011**, exhibit relatively better retention in the longer term (12% after 12 months). This 
could indicate that some events or strategies implemented during those months had a positive effect on long-term 
retention.
- We can see that **December 2010** has an Outlier where 50% are still active at almost the year mark.
""")
st.subheader('Business Recommendations:')
st.write("""
- **Early Churn:** Since most of the cohorts experience a sharp drop in retention between the 1st and 2nd months, the 
business should focus on engaging customers **immediately after their first purchase**. Initiatives like onboarding 
programs, discounts, or personalized recommendations could help reduce early churn.
- **Critical Retention Period:** Since retention declines sharply in the first few months (typically up to 4 months), 
strategies to boost engagement and customer satisfaction during this time could have a strong impact on overall 
retention rates.
- **Cohort-specific Analysis:** Some cohorts perform better than others. The business should investigate what actions 
or promotions were happening in months like **December 2010** or **August 2011**, where retention is relatively higher, 
and replicate those successful strategies for other cohorts.
- **Long-term Engagement:** After around 6 months, retention stabilizes for most cohorts, albeit at a much lower level. 
Offering loyalty programs or incentives for customers to return periodically could help maintain engagement over the 
long term.
""")
st.subheader('Next Steps:')
st.markdown("""
- **Analyze Other Variables:** Examine additional factors (e.g., customer demographics, purchase categories, acquisition 
channels, marketing tactics) to see if certain groups or segments have better retention. This can reveal deeper insights 
into why certain cohorts retain better. 
- **Segment Analysis:** Look into Demographic segmentation and Behavioral segmentation.
- **Predictive Modelling:** Build a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on the cohort analysis data. 
Use features like: time since last purchase, total number of purchases, demographic and behavioral variables.
- **A/B Testing of Retention Strategies:** Implement the retention strategies (e.g., loyalty programs, re-engagement 
campaigns, personalized offers) and run A/B tests to measure the impact on customer retention for different cohorts.
